## A relational database example ##
Let's consider a database design for company meetings. A **meeting** can be either an **interview** or a **consultation** . A meeting can be sent to individuals or **groups** of individuals whose **contact** information is already saved in the database. Therefore, a meeting can of two types and they can have both individuals added to the meeting and/or pre-existing groups of contacts. In order to track the individuals who attended a meeting, there has to be a direct association between a meeting and a contact. This is because group details can be edited by design for instance, after a meeting has taken place.
